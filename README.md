# Contracts for Nordle (Wordle on the blockchain)

This was inspired by [Loot (for Adventurers)](https://opensea.io/collection/lootproject) and the hit game [Nordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html). It was a project to mess around with the idea of editing/adding onto on-chain metadata of NFTs. It has many of the same mechanics of Nordle, but with blockchain interactions. 

Each game is also minted as an NFT: https://testnets.opensea.io/assets/rinkeby/0xd51ded6bb2997d7eb5e39dfa48fe6fbf78840142/1
