# Contracts for Nordle (Wordle on the blockchain)

This was a project to mess around with the idea of editing/adding onto on-chain metadata of NFTs. This was originally inspired by [Loot (for Adventurers)](https://opensea.io/collection/lootproject) and the hit game [Nordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html).
